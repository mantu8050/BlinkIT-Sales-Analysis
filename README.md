#  BlinkIT Grocery Sales Performance Analysis

##  Project Overview

*Welcome to my latest Data Science portfolio project!* 

This analysis focuses on a grocery sales dataset to uncover performance trends, identify key sales drivers, and provide actionable recommendations for optimization. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence, a fundamental skill as I continue to step into the world of Data Analysis.

## Key Features

* *Advanced Data Wrangling:* Cleaning and merging data from multiple sources (as suggested by the file structure) and handling missing values (e.g., in Item Weight).
* *KPI Derivation:* Calculating core metrics for sales, item volume, and customer satisfaction (Rating).
* *Outlet Performance Analysis:* Segmenting sales by Outlet Location Type, Outlet Size, and Outlet Type.
* *Product Segmentation:* Analyzing sales based on Item Fat Content and Item Type.
* *Interactive Dashboard:* A cohesive visual summary of all primary insights.

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following global KPIs were calculated to set the overall performance baseline:

| KPI | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Sum of Total Sales* | $\mathbf{1,201,681 }$ | The total revenue across all outlets. |
| *Average Sales* | $\mathbf{141}$ | The average sales value per transaction. |
| *Number of Items Sold* | $\mathbf{8,523}$ | The total count of unique items in the dataset. |
| *Average Customer Rating* | $\mathbf{3.97}$ | The average satisfaction score for the outlets. |

### Top-Level Insights (Based on Analysis Data):

1.  *Outlet Location:* *Tier 3* locations generate the highest volume of sales, suggesting a strong market presence or higher purchasing power in those areas.
2.  *Outlet Size:* *Medium* sized outlets are the top revenue drivers.
3.  *Fat Content:* Items classified as *Low Fat* contribute significantly more to total sales than Regular items (approx. 65% of total sales).
4.  *Temporal Trend:* Sales are consistently high across the years, but the analysis should focus on improving visibility or promotions in newer outlets.

##  Technologies & Tools

* *Data Source:* Microsoft Excel (.xlsx and derived .csv files)
* *Analysis/Modeling:*
    * *MS Excel:* Utilized for data modeling, pivot table creation, and dashboard construction.
* *Visualization:* MS Excel Visualization
